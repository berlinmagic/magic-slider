# Magic-Slider

	jQuery-Content-Slider based on Coda-Slider.

## magic-slider is based on:

	Coda-Slider 2.0 .. by Niall Doherty, http://www.ndoherty.biz/ .. (the original)
	Coda-Slider 2.1 .. by Joel Gillman, https://github.com/jgillman/Coda-Slider-2.1 .. (original plus carousel)
	Coda-Slider 2.1 .. by ??? on faceit, http://faceit.com.ua/scripts/coda-slider_2.1.zip .. (vertical-idea .. doesn't work!)
	moutardeSlider  .. by Francois Stephany, https://github.com/fstephany/moutardeSlider .. (nicer code, .. but some bugs)

Thanks A lot!

## magic-slider improvements

	vertical-slide .. slide up and down including the autoHeight feauture
	carousell / invinite sliding .. no scroll back, just invinite sliding
	no panel-title needed .. if no panel-title is provided, panel-count is used for tabs
