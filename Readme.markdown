# Magic-Slider
## ( maybe Coda-Slider3.0 )

	jQuery-Content-Slider based on Coda-Slider.

## magic-slider is based on:

	Coda-Slider 2.0 .. by Niall Doherty, [http://www.ndoherty.biz/](http://www.ndoherty.biz/) .. (the original)
	Coda-Slider 2.1 .. by Joel Gillman, [https://github.com/jgillman/Coda-Slider-2.1](https://github.com/jgillman/Coda-Slider-2.1) .. (original plus carousel)
	Coda-Slider 2.1 .. by ??? on faceit, [http://faceit.com.ua/scripts/coda-slider_2.1.zip](http://faceit.com.ua/scripts/coda-slider_2.1.zip) .. (vertical-idea .. doesn't work!)
	moutardeSlider  .. by Francois Stephany, [https://github.com/fstephany/moutardeSlider](https://github.com/fstephany/moutardeSlider) .. (nicer code, .. but some bugs)

Thanks A lot!

## magic-slider improvements

	vertical-sliding .. slide up and down including the autoHeight feauture
	carousell / invinite sliding .. no scroll back, just invinite sliding
	no panel-title needed .. if no panel-title is provided, panel-count is used for tabs ( only for headline or Text-Links)
	headline changer .. need an outside Title for youre Slider, here you are! .. ( uses panelTitle ! )
	external Trigger highlighting .. Now if you want the current externalTrigger is marked as current
	slider in slider .. Now its possible to place a slider inside another slider! .. Also rel-linking is reworked
	no more sliderCount .. The slider now use its own ID, instead of its count ... ( Slider needs an ID ! )
	better rel-linking .. because of the new slider-identifying you can just use the slider-ID as rel, no more counting
